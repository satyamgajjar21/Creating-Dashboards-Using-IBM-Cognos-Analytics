Creating Dashboards Using IBM Cognos Analytics <br>
This repository highlights my work in utilizing IBM Cognos Analytics to create interactive dashboards for analyzing sales and service metrics in a car dealership chain. I independently designed and implemented these dashboards, providing key insights into performance indicators for sales and service operations.

Project Overview
In this project, I:

Utilized IBM Cognos Analytics to create dynamic dashboards with intuitive visualizations.
Analyzed data from the Auto Group Data Module to derive actionable insights.
Captured and presented Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for sales and service departments.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the IBM Accelerator Catalog and is included within the Cognos environment as the Auto Group Data Module. The dataset was customized and leveraged to meet the project objectives.

Dashboard Design and Execution
Sales Dashboard
Created a tabbed dashboard using the 4 small rectangles and 1 large rectangle template.
Renamed the dashboard tab to Sales.
Captured KPIs:
Panel 1: Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of USD).
Panel 2: Quantity sold.
Panel 3: Quantity sold by model (visualized as a bar chart).
Panel 4: Average quantity sold.
Panel 5: Profit by Dealer ID (displayed in the large rectangle as a column chart, sorted in ascending order).
Service Dashboard
Created a tabbed dashboard using the 2 x 2 rectangle areas template.
Renamed the dashboard tab to Service.
Captured KPIs:
Panel 1 (Top Left): Number of recalls per car model (as a column chart).
Panel 2 (Top Right): Customer sentiment comparison (positive, neutral, and negative reviews as a treemap).
Panel 3 (Bottom Left): Quantity of cars sold per month compared to profit (visualized as a line and column chart).
Panel 4 (Bottom Right): Number of recalls by model and affected system (as a heat map to identify outliers).
Exported Dashboards
Exported the dashboards as PDFs with filters included.
Saved the output locally for documentation and review.
Key Outcomes
Through this project, I:

Gained hands-on experience creating insightful dashboards in IBM Cognos Analytics.
Analyzed and visualized critical KPIs for sales and service operations.
Designed dynamic and interactive dashboards to aid in decision-making.
Delivered professional-quality reports by exporting dashboards in PDF format.
This repository demonstrates my ability to independently utilize business intelligence tools like IBM Cognos Analytics to analyze, visualize, and present data effectively for real-world scenarios.
